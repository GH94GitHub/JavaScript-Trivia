# JavaScript Trivia

This single page application will be a trivia game. There will be one question shown to the user at a time,
with the ability for the user to move forward and backward through questions. On the last question the
user will have the ability to check their score and will be prompted if they want to continue if they forgot
to answer a question. When the user submits their answers, they will be graded and a summary of the
results will be shown, with a rank given to the user depending on how they did.
